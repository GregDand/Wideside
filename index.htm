<blockquote align=left>GMC's own V8 was the 336 in³ (5.5 L) OHV/pushrod engine. It used a 3.875 in (98.4 mm) bore and was produced only in 1958 and 1959. While both the '58 and '59 GMC V8 engines were advertised as 336 in³ (5.5 L), the '58 version was based on the Pontiac 370 in³, but with a smaller 3.875" bore giving a 336.1 in³.</blockquote>

4 speed Hydramatic
</center><blockquote>
The all cast-iron Hydramatic was the heaviest automatic transmission ever produced for automobiles. The heaviest of them all was the Truck Hydra-Matic version offered by GM Truck and Coach Division in its line of light- and medium-duty trucks.</p>
The Hydramatic used a two-element fluid coupling (not a torque converter, which has at least three elements, the pump, turbine, and stator.</p>
Standard ratios for the original Hydra-Matic were 4.08:1, 2.63:1, 1.55:1, and 1.00:1 in the light truck applications.</p>
The original Hydra-Matic continued to be used in light trucks and other commercial vehicles until 1962. It was subsequently replaced in that role by Chevrolet Division's Powerglide (where it was dubbed "Pow-R-Flow") in the GMC light truck line, and later, in 1966, with the Turbo Hydra-Matic (THM) in GMC light trucks, whose simplified design was much less costly to manufacture. Chevrolet Division's light truck line used the less-than-adequate Powerglide all through the 1960s until Turbo-Hydramatic was made standard in 1969. Cast-iron Hydra-Matic production ceased at Willow Run after the 1962 model year.
